                    These sites were designed for a historical showcase of the different design styles from each era. These sites in particular are designed after the earliest concepts of a Screen display, GUI, and the first sites on the internet (and subsequently, the first web browsers). Participants in the event were invited to interact with simplified versions of these design styles to be able to understand how designers thought of early computer concepts and to see what interacting with early computer systems was like.
