                    'Cerulean Cycle' is a game based on a hypothetical future reality where humans have since left to space, and the only remaining inhabitants are the automata that they created. The world has been severely altered by human activity as a result of the extreme development of technology, inspired by cold war and todays technological races. The environment is thus designed after the new world, where the player can experience for themselves what this hypothetical taken to the extreme looks like.
