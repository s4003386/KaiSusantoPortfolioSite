        <div class="BioText">
            My name is Kai Susanto. I'm a <mark>digital designer</mark> who is striving to make imaginative, beautiful, and impactful games, websites, and other interactive media. I love to believe in the media I create, where it can have a life of its own in another users head. Immersive environments like those are something I am deeply passionate about creating and experiencing, where strong visual direction, storytelling through sound and environment, and interactivity come together to make people feel new things. I am familiar with various software to create my projects, including 
            <mark>Unreal engine/Unity</mark>, <mark>Figma/Visual studio</mark>, image creating software such as <mark>Photoshop/Clip studio paint/Illustrator</mark>, and sound software such as <mark>Reaper</mark>. Subsequently, I am somewhat familiar with <mark>C++</mark> and <mark>HTML</mark>  programming languages in order to create interactive experiences. 
            I currently plan to further develop my craft of programming, digital art, and sound.
