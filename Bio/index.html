My name is Kai Susanto. I'm a digital designer who is striving to make imaginative, beautiful, and impactful games, websites, and other interactive media. I love to believe in the media I create, where it can have a life of its own in another users head. Immersive environments like those are something I am deeply passionate about creating and experiencing, where strong visual direction, storytelling through sound and environment, and interactivity come together to make people feel new things. I am familiar with various software to create my projects, including Unreal engine/Unity, Figma/Visual studio, and image creating software such as Photoshop/Clip studio paint/Illustrator. Subsequently, I am somewhat familiar with C++ and HTML programming languages in order to create interactive experiences. 
I currently plan to further develop my craft of programming, digital art, and sound.
